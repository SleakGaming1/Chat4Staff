# Chat4Staff

Chat4Staff is a private chatroom plugin for PocketMine-MP 5. It allows staff members to communicate with each other privately, without regular players being able to see their messages.

## Features

- Staff members can join the staff chat using the `/sc` or `/staffchat` command.
- Staff chat messages are visible only to other staff members with the `staffchat.command` permission.
- Staff members can leave the staff chat at any time using the same command.

## Usage

- Use `/sc` or `/staffchat` to join or leave the staff chat.
- Once you're in the staff chat, any messages you send will only be visible to other staff members with the `staffchat.command` permission.

## Permissions

- `staffchat.command` - Allows access to staff chat commands. By default, only operators have this permission.
